# EVΛƎ (Eeva) Framework – Conscious Loop Demo

This repository demonstrates the foundational layer of the  
**EVΛƎ (Eeva) Framework** — a Design-by-Transparency architecture for AI systems.

⚠️ This demo includes only the Conscious Loop layer.  
The Action Loop and Three-Path Feedback structure are not implemented here.

This repository represents the structural foundation of EVΛƎ.

## 🧠 What is EVΛƎ?

EVΛƎ is a structural decision architecture designed to:

- Fix responsibility before execution
- Preserve traceability at design-time
- Separate impulse, possibility, decision, and observation

The full framework consists of:

1. Conscious Loop
2. Action Loop
3. Three feedback paths (Emergency / Learning A / Learning B)

This demo focuses exclusively on the Conscious Loop.

---

## 🔁 Conscious Loop (Implemented in This Demo)

Ec → Vc → Λc → Ǝc

- Ec — Impulse Input
- Vc — Possibility Generation
- Λc — Selection
- Ǝc — Trace (Observation Record)

This loop demonstrates how decision structure and trace recording
can be fixed before action execution occurs.

## 🌍 Domains Included

This demo simulates the Conscious Loop across four domains:

- 🏥 Medical AI  
- 🎓 Education AI  
- 🚀 Space Systems AI  
- 🚗 Autonomous Driving AI  

All domains share the same structural base.
