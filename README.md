# EVΛƎ (Eeva) Framework – Conscious Loop Demo

This repository demonstrates the foundational layer of the **EVΛƎ (Eeva) Framework**, a Design-by-Transparency architecture for AI systems.

⚠️ This demo includes only the **Conscious Loop** layer.
The **Action Loop** and **Three-Path Feedback structure** are not implemented in this repository.

This repository represents the structural foundation of EVΛƎ.

## Name and Symbol

EVΛƎ is pronounced **"Eeva"**.

The final character **Ǝ** is called **"Echo"**.
It represents **Observation** and structural trace recording within the framework.

---

## 🧠 What is EVΛƎ?

EVΛƎ is a structural decision architecture designed to:

* Fix responsibility **before execution**
* Preserve traceability at **design-time**
* Separate impulse, possibility, decision, and observation
* Prevent responsibility from being assigned only after outcomes occur

The full framework consists of:

1. Conscious Loop
2. Action Loop
3. Three feedback paths (Emergency / Learning A / Learning B)

This demo focuses exclusively on the **Conscious Loop**, which serves as the architectural base layer.

---

## 🔁 Conscious Loop (Implemented in This Demo)

Ec → Vc → Λc → Ǝc

* **Ec** — Impulse Input
* **Vc** — Possibility Generation
* **Λc** — Selection
* **Ǝc** — Trace (Observation Record)

This loop demonstrates how decision structure and trace recording can be fixed **before action execution occurs**.

Rather than asking "Was the AI correct?" after deployment,
EVΛƎ asks:

> How is responsibility structurally defined before execution begins?

---

## 🌍 Domains Included

This demo simulates the Conscious Loop across four domains:

* 🏥 Medical AI
* 🎓 Education AI
* 🚀 Space Systems AI
* 🚗 Autonomous Driving AI

All domains share the same structural base.

The purpose is not domain specialization,
but demonstration of architectural consistency across high-impact systems.

---

## 🔧 What This Repository Includes

* UI demonstration of the Conscious Loop
* Trace visualization
* Simulated outputs via a mock engine
* Structural separation of impulse, generation, selection, and trace

---

## ❌ What Is Not Included

* Action Loop implementation
* Three feedback paths
* Proprietary scoring logic
* Production thresholds
* Commercial decision algorithms

---

## Why This Matters

Most AI systems focus on improving model accuracy.

EVΛƎ focuses on something different:

> Where and when is responsibility structurally fixed?

By separating impulse, possibility generation, decision, and trace,
the architecture prevents responsibility from drifting into post-hoc explanation.

This demo shows the foundational layer of that structural approach.

---

## Future Expansion

The full EVΛƎ framework extends this foundation
with an Action Loop and a Three-Path Feedback structure,
enabling reinforcement, revision, and emergency handling.

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository demonstrates the structural foundation
of the EVΛƎ architecture.

It is intended for architectural exploration and discussion.
It is not a production system.
